# DIVAGO - An accommodation browser

Of course, the data displayed on the page is completely fake, and the project itself is a frontend example.

It was built using React and CodeSandbox, for Acámica. This is the 3rd project of the Frontend course.

This project really helped me understand some key concepts of React, and furthermore I'm glad I was presented with this challenge.
